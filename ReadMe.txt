Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project : Introduction

This repository contains my work for the Data Science course project.


Step 1: Was to download the raw data from the url : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR

%20Dataset.zip 

unzip and place the files in the directory where I will be setting the working directory(e.g: C:/Data) for R.

I set the working directory in R where i have my raw data file.Using this command :setwd("C:/Data")

Then I worte an R script to load the training, test and features data. This script then merges, cleans and creates a tidy data set. 

This script can be found at https://github.com/bganapathy/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/run_analysis.R 


About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains the R functions used and the transformations performed with the resulting data and variables.
